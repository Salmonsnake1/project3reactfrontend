## This is my Project 3 React Front End. This connects to the backend of Project 2, so a user can interact with the music album database. It can be found at the following link: [https://project3reactfrontend.vercel.app/](url)

### This project is a music album database, it allows a user to do the following:

* Add a new album to the databsae
* Edit an existing album and save the changes
* Delete an existing album
* See all entries in the database
* Hide all entries in the database

This has been displayed using React and React Bootstrap. The API calls with axios.

### Future potential updates:

* Searching by multiple fields at once.
* Back end check if album entry already exists to prevent duplicates.
* Album covers
